hasql-url
###########

A simple URL parser.
Useful for heroku or anytime you get a URI for your connection credentials.
Heavily inspired (read copy-pasted) from
`the equivalent library for postgresql-simple <https://github.com/futurice/postgresql-simple-url>`_.

It uses the `Network.URI library <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/network-uri-2.6.3.0/docs/Network-URI.html>`_
 to make the initial URI parsing.
